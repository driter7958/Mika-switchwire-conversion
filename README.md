# Mika Switchwire conversion


My Mika switchwire conversion is for the **Ender_SW** project, which details a complete **conversion of the popular Creality Ender 3 Pro/V2 3D printer into a Voron Switchwire** (a CoreXZ printer).

### Project Overview

- **Goal:** To fully convert the budget-friendly Ender 3/V2 platform into a high-performance Voron Switchwire-style printer, adhering closely to the Voron design aesthetics and guidelines.
    
- **Design Basis:** It draws inspiration from a previous conversion by Triano but features a full re-design to improve structural integrity, aesthetics, and to specifically allow for a visually pleasant and functional **enclosure**.
    
- **Key Features & Upgrades:**
    
    - Implements the Voron Switchwire's **CoreXZ motion system** for improved speed and quality.
        
    - Uses **MGN12H Linear Rails** (often five, including dual Y-axis rails) for precision movement.
        
    - Maintains a printing volume of approximately **$220 \times 220 \times 220 \text{ mm}^3$**.
        
    - Includes **CAD files** (.f3d and .STEP) and **DXF files** for cutting enclosure panels.
        
    - Prioritizes using standard Voron screw and hardware sizes for consistency.
        
- **Recyclable Ender Parts:** The project is designed to reuse several key components from the original Ender 3/V2, including:
    
    - The **frame** (with a required X-axis extrusion modification).
        
    - The **MeanWell PSU** (Power Supply Unit).
        
    - The **heated bed assembly**.
        
    - Original electronics board and most cables (outside the cable chains).
        
    - The **XYZ stepper motors** (if pulleys can be removed).
        

This conversion aims to provide a reliable, enclosed, high-speed 3D printer experience by leveraging the existing Ender 3 frame and power components.
